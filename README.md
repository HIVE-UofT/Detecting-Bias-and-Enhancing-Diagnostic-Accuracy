# Detecting Bias and Enhancing Diagnostic Accuracy in Large Language Models for Healthcare

## Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our paper, "Detecting Bias and Enhancing Diagnostic Accuracy in Large Language Models for Healthcare." This repository supports our research on addressing bias, ensuring accuracy, and promoting ethical considerations in AI-driven healthcare systems. It introduces novel datasets and models designed to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) in clinical applications, providing tools to evaluate and mitigate biases and improve diagnostic reliability.

## Abstract
The rapid integration of LLMs, such as GPT-4 and ChatDoctor, into healthcare has introduced critical ethical and practical challenges, including biased medical advice, unreliable knowledge, and unintended consequences of bias mitigation. This research aims to:

- Expose hidden biases in health-related AI outputs.

- Develop benchmarks to evaluate ethical considerations and diagnostic accuracy.

- Create tools to mitigate bias while preserving clinical utility.

## Contributions
Our key contributions in this work are threefold:

1. **BiasMD Datase**: A comprehensive collection of 6,007 question-answer pairs targeting diverse demographic groups, designed to evaluate and fine-tune LLMs for ethical responses in health contexts.
2. **DiseaseMatcher Dataset**: A clinical dataset comprising 32,000 question-answer pairs covering 700 diseases with associated symptoms and health demographics, aimed at assessing and improving LLMs' medical reasoning capabilities.
3. **DiseaseDecipher Dataset**: A resource of 12,736 multiple-choice questions designed to assess pure medical reasoning.
